Instructions edit js-files

Fork oref0

Change the code as you please in the folder lib, (for instance determine-basal.js).

Copy the ”webpack.config” file from FreeAPS X/scripts to your ”oref0” -folder (same folder where the ”lib” older is located)

In terminal cd into the same ”oref0” folder

Install Node. For Mac OS pkg:  

64-bit

Install web pack (stay in same directory as before in terminal):
npm install --save-dev webpack

Install webpack CLI: 
npm install -D webpack-cli

Run web pack command:
npx webpack

Open your oref0 folder in Finder. 
Open the ”dist” folder. 
Copy the js file/s you changed

Open freeaps x folder in Finder.

Open FreeAPS/Resources folder.
Open javascript/bundle folder.

Replace the current js.file or files with the copied changed minimized files.
Make sure the new files have exactly the same file name as the one you moved/deleted/replaced.

Some files are renamed when compressed. For instance determine-basal.js is renamed to determineBasal.js. You need to change the name back before pasting into FAX.


Build FreeAPS X again.

That’s it!
